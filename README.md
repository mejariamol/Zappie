# Zappie
<p>English Vocabulary Helper Chat Bot<br>Windows UWP Application</p>
# Short Description
<p>The Chat-bot plays a word game with user. Initially Zappie starts with any random word and countdown of 20sec starts for user in which user has to say a word which begins with the last letter of that word, and game goes on like this. If user manages to say a word in first 10 sec he/she scores +2 points, +1 for next 10 sec and -1 if fails to do so, and Zappie takes that turn. Also Zappie tells meaning of any word on insisting.</p>
# Lets make it better!
<ul>
  <li>UI freezes for every time when user sends a word till Zappie says the next word due to the next word generation method runs on the same thread.</li>
  <li>Implementing Oral communication between Zappie and User using Bing's speech API.</li>
  <li>Making new levels in game on parameters like word length, category etc.</li>
  <li>Implementing an AI algorithm which can detect the category of words in which user's vocabulary is poor and gives words from that category.</li>
  <li>Now Zappie says word meaning in English on insisting. Implementing the word meanings in all regional languages.</li>
  <li>Now I have implemented a local database file in the app for words and meanings. This would increase app size in future if implemented other languages. It would be better if there is a REST api on server on which all background process runs.</li>
</ul>
